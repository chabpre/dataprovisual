After everybody was forced in to a lockdown state companies had to find ways to make sure that movies and tv shows got to the people at home, so new and old streaming services started to rise. Hulu, HBO max, Disney plus, etc. In the end those that people used during covid are the ones that are still being used to this day. I was unable to find a chart that has the streaming services by uses like the one above."
